I've been using zsh for a few years now and I truly love it.

At the same time, TBH, I was jealous of a specific fish shell feature - autosuggestions.
As the name implies, It suggests commands as you type based on history.

**_Today I Learned_** about [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) plugin that does exactly that!

#### Usage
Start typing a command and you'll see a completion offered after the cursor in gray.    
Accept the suggestion by pressing the â†’ key or End.

#### Installation
Install the plugin manually, with [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) or using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), all well documented in the [README](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/README.md#installation)

You can partially accept a suggestion, configure the style, the key bindings, and even the suggestion strategy.
