How many times have you left the terminal to search the web for a coding solution?

Whether it is the Python dict comprehension, a CSS Flexbox property, `sed` command syntax or the
order of commits during `git squash`.

Today I learned about the AMAZING [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) command line tool.

It quickly scrapes code from StackOverflow top answers and outputs the solution in your terminal.

#### Installation

```shell
$ pip install howdoi
```

#### Usage

```shell
$ howdoi untar a tar file
tar â€“xzf filename.tgz -C /target/directory
```

You can change the source url for answers, the underline search engine and even colorize the output.
