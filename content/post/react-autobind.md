If you're working on a React/React Native project you've probably had to deal with binding event
handlers.     
It isn't a React specific issue, but a part of the way functions work in JavaScript.

Manually binding each component method may sound considerable. 
This is the "old school" way - bind in `constructor()`:

```
this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
```

But believe me when I tell you, repeating it for 5+ methods is both annoying and quite ugly:

```
this.addComment = this.addComment.bind(this)
this.removeComment = this.removeComment.bind(this)
this.editComment = this.editComment.bind(this)
this.fetchComments = this.fetchComments.bind(this)
this.clapComment = this.clapComment.bind(this)
this.bookmarkComment = this.bookmarkComment.bind(this)
```

While I'm a big fan of arrow function expressions and the [public class field feature](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/), which uses the first to solve the problem ("Lexical Scoping"), it is still experimental and not yet part of ECMAScript standard (stage 3).

#### Solution - Autobinding Packages

There are 3 packages I came across:

1. [Autobind Decorator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autobind-decorator) - Coming from Python,
   the decorators pattern of adding `@autobind` before methods seemed almost natural.     
   But I get why developers prefer not to add a line above each individual method inside every React component.

2. [Class Autobind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-autobind) - The package we chose in [BigPanda](https://www.bigpanda.io/). It uses a function inside your constructor that automatically binds the Component's methods to the instance itself:
   ```
   class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      autobind(this);
  }
   ```
   In case you plan to subclass the component, specify the prototype as the second parameter.


3. [React Autobind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-autobind) - Useful when you want to select
   specific methods to bind.

Let me know if you have different solutions.
