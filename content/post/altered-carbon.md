I often take screenshots of my source-code, to place in a slide or tweet.

Sure, for blogs [gist](https://gist.github.com/) is a great option, especially when your readers plan to make some adjustments. But even that can be too much of an effort.

_**Today I learned**_ about [carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/), an awesome open source tool for creating and sharing beautiful code images!

#### Features

The ones I found useful:

* Drag-n-drop your code
* Theme selection, the cool kids use Solarized (Dark)
* Language-based syntax highlighting
* Cool fonts
* Line numbers
* Background color/image and blur
